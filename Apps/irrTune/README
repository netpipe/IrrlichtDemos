tuneit -- A simple command-line instrument tuner for ALSA and JACK
------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

Tune-It is a very simple command-line based instrument tuner for Linux.

It uses two different algorithms for pitch detection.  By default,
a simple and fast Schmitt Trigger based algorithm is used to detect
the fundamental frequency of an instrument.  For better and more reliable
results, there is an alternative FFT based algorithm which is much more CPU
intensive.

As audio capture backends ALSA and JACK are supported.  By default, tuneit
will try to use the hw:0,0 ALSA device.

Options:

tuneit [OPTIONS...] [captureDevice]
Valid options:
	-f		Use the more CPU intensive FFT based algorithm
	-i		List available input ports and exit
	-j		Use JACK as the audio transport system
	-l LATENCY	Measurement window size in 1/N seconds (default is 10)
	-r RATE		Set desired ALSA sample rate (default is 48000)
	-t HERTZ	Tune the A note of the scale (default is 440.0)
