IMPORTANT: This licence is NOT related to any internal or external libraries (irrlicht, audiere, etc, etc) NOR to the used audio codecs (Ogg, Flac, Mp3, etc, etc) NOR to the included music files NOR any other content developed by others. They have their own licences, and this specific licence doesnt overrides theirs of course! This licence is related to my own work only! So, if you want to know more, please visit their projects webpages, specially if you want to use them for commercial purposes.
