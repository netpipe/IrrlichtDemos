00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm walking away

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Another day has died

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm walking alone

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I wish to dream again...

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All I ask in this life

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's to find some place to rest

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Inside my heart

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Longing to disappear...

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Many years without a sun

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wrapped in shadows of the past

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It seems already written in the stars

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No wind will be so cold

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And no rain will be so hard... 

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
(Bring to life)
I'm returned from death 

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
(Have no fear)
Burning all the scariest ghosts 

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
(Life's so frail)
In the sands of desert 

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
(Against the stream)
In the deepest pit of mind

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
(Bring to life)
Where the days are dark

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
(Have no fear)
When the gravity's reversed 

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
(Life's so frail)
Resist, be strong, don't stop, go fast!

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
(Against the stream)
Beyond the end!...

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Beyond the end...
