00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon

00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He could not see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
