00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I love to rise in a summer morn,
When the birds sing on every tree;

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The distant huntsman winds his horn,
And the sky-lark sings with me.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
O! what sweet company.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But to go to school in a summer morn,
O! it drives all joy away!

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Under a cruel eye outworn,
The little ones spend the day,

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In sighing and dismay.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ah! then at times I drooping sit,
And spend many an anxious hour,

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Nor in my book can I take delight,
Nor sit in learnings bower,

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Worn thro' with the dreary shower.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can the bird that is born for joy,
Sit in a cage and sing,

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How can a child when fears annoy,
But droop his tender wing,

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And forget his youthful spring.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
O! father and mother, if buds are nip'd,
And blossoms blown away,

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And if the tender plants are strip'd
Of their joy in the springing day,

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
By sorrow and cares dismay.

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How shall the summer arise in joy.
Or the summer fruits appear.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy
Or bless the mellowing year,

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When the blasts of winter appear.
