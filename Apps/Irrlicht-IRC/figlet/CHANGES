Changes in FIGlet 2.2
---------------------

FIGlet 2.2 is a moderate revision of FIGlet 2.1.2.  The new features are:

o	font files and control files can be compressed using ``zip'', and
	will be automatically decompressed

o	new commands in controlfiles provide support for
	single-byte (default), double-byte, HZ, Shift-JIS, and Unicode
	UTF-8 encodings of the input

o	ISO 2022 escape sequences are decoded and interpreted

o	control files can now have the format of Unicode Consortium
	mapping tables (two columns of numbers representing
	input character and output character, no ranges, # comments)

o	new options -s (smush, same as -m-2), -k (kern, same as -m0),
	-S (forced smushing), and -W (full width, same as -m-1) make
	-m option unnecessary except for font designers.  The -S option
	works even if the font's smushmode is 0 or -1, in which case
	the smushmode is read from a new parameter in the
	font's first line, or does universal overlapping if no such parameter
	exists

o	universal smushing (-o option to force it, but -S will use it
	if no smush rules are available) makes FIGcharacters overlap by
	one place independent of how they are constructed
	more fonts smushable.

o	file "figmagic" can be appended to your system magic number
	file to make the "file" command recognize FIGlet files

o	file "figfont.txt" is an implementation-independent specification
	for FIGlet fonts and control files

o	integrated support for extended characters (extended Latin in
	"standard", Greek in "big", katakana in "banner", Hebrew in new
	"ivrit" fonts) with appropriate controlfiles

o	smushing rule 16 has changed slightly: "/\" now smushes
	into "|" and "\/" smushes into "Y"; "><" still smushes
	into "X" and "<>" is still not smushed at all.

o	-A option introduced in FIGlet 2.1.2 is now optional;
	if any words appear on the command line after the options,
	they are formatted, and the standard input is not read.

Changes in FIGlet 2.1.2
------------------------

FIGlet 2.1.2 is a minor revision of FIGlet 2.1.1.  The files
README, FTP-NOTE, figlet.c and figlet.6 have been changed.  All other
files are identical with the 2.1.1 release.

o	The only new option is -A, which causes FIGlet to read input
	from the command line.

These changes were made by Gilbert Healton <ghealton@nmia.com> as Glenn
Chappell is now busy as a new professor of Mathematics.

Changes in FIGlet 2.1
----------------------

A number of minor bugs and major incompatibility problems have been
fixed.  FIGlet 2.1 should compile correctly on many operating systems for
which FIGlet 2.0 did not.

o	The "-F" command line option, which used to list all the available
	fonts, has been removed, since it made FIGlet incompatible with some
	operating systems.  It has been replaced by the "figlist" script.  The
	"showfigfonts" script has been updated so that it no longer requires
	the "-F" option to be available.

o	The FIGlet font file format has been extended to allow an arbitrarily
	large number of characters.  The ISO Latin-1 character set, which
	includes many accented letters and special symbols, has been added to
	most standard fonts.

o	FIGlet can now print right-to-left.  This can be specified on the
	command line ("-R") or in the font file.  Thus, for example, Hebrew and
	Arabic fonts can be handled more easily.

o	FIGlet can now right justify its output.  This is the default when
	right-to-left printing is selected.  It can also be specified on the
	command line ("-r").

o	FIGlet now supports "control files".  These can be used to change which
	character FIGlet will print when it sees a certain input character --
	sort of an expanded version of the "-D" option.  For example, a control
	file could convert lower-case letters to upper-case or map certain
	ASCII characters to accented letters.  Control file names end with the
	suffix ".flc".  Select a control file by using "-C controlfile" on the
	command line.  Several controlfiles can be used at once by giving
	muliple "-C" options.

o	There is now a way for programs that use FIGlet to get various
	information from FIGlet, for example, what version of FIGlet is being
	used or the name of the default font directory.  This information is
	gotten through the "-I" option.  See the man page for details.
