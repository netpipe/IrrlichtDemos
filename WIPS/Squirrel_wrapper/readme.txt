Squirrel_Wrapper V0.1
by Evo
September 18, 2006


This is the first version of my Squirrel wrapper class. It provides a interface between the Irrlicht 3D engine and the Squirrel scripting language. It allows you to embed Squirrel into your project, making available a set of Irrlicht functions to your scripts.

This is definitely a work in progress. I have only made available the Irr. functions that I needed for the demo. If you need other functions or have added functions yourself then please post in the forum or send me a pm.

I have included a demo. It is loosly based on the Axe-effect commercials. If you don't know what that is you can see one here: http://www.metacafe.com/watch/77259/girls_after_me/

Source and executable can be found here: http://home.wanadoo.nl/iherweij/download/Squirrel_wrapper.zip


The following open source libraries were used to create this code:
http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net
http://squirrel-lang.org
