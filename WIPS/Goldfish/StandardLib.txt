// DOCUMENTATION
//===============
//
// This is the standard user-defined library for Goldfish.
//
// Since / had not yet been defined, it has been defined above.
// The backslash has two functions:
// 	> To ignore characters
//		>> between // and the newline character
//		>> between /* and */
//	> To divide two numbers
// 
// When it ignores characters, / looks at characters from the file in the runtime stack GIVEN_SUB from the end.
// By doing so, the user can define / in their program to use the StandardLib definition without having to worry about it only operating in their definition's {} (which is default).
//
// When dividing numbers, / uses the system's built-in system division function which requests two inputs, a numerator and a denominator.
