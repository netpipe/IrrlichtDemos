How to use definitions of tokens in other libraries:

Define a single character (e.g. #) whose definition is to get the next token and search for its definition in a spefic file.

ex:

define #
{
token = system previous name; // obtains the next token and stores it in the new variable "token"
in "Library_file.txt" Type token; // find the object of type "Type" in the library file "Library_file.txt"
token = system previous value; // stores the final value returned from the definition in the library file
return token; // returns the value of token
delete token; // delete the variable so that it isn't using up memory
}
