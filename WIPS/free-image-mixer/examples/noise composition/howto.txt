How to do noise composition?

1)Draw some random lines
2)save the image
3)Resize the image to 1/4 (halves width and height)
4)copy the resized image 4 times to fill a new image
5)copy and paste little pieces to cover the seams (there will be 1 vertical seem and 1 horizontal seem in the center of the image)
6)repeat how many times you like from 2)

Than start from the first image and apply a gaussian blur for example 25. Reduce gaussian blur 
for each image.

1st image blur size 25
2nd image blur size 10
3rd image blur size 5
4th image blur size 1
5th image blur size nothing.

Than just apply the script in main.cpp wich combines the images with different weights. Changin
The pattern and blur size can cause different and nice noises to appears.
