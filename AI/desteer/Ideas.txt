//on each steering behavior.  This would allow users to create pluggable behaviors in their own code.
Finished this.

Abstract localspace and mobile entity, have IMobileEntityWithLocalspace, mobile entity should have
function getLocalSpace, IMobileEntityWithLocalSpace should return this on that function.

Write an ScriptedSteeringBehavior class that takes in an io_block and gets a vector back,this should
allow scripted steering behaviors to be used if I can tie in some likemagick stuff.
