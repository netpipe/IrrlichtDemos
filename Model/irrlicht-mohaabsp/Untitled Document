OK I uploaded what I got so far (not much). It needs proper shader loading, and LOD terrain drawing (the blank spots on the ground), which I'll take care of soon.

http://home.arcor.de/wombat23/irrlicht-mohaabsp.7z

CMOHAALevelMesh.cpp and .h must be added to source/Irrlicht/ they are a modification based on the pre-existing CQ3LevelMesh files. they should be added to the project / makefile.

The archive also contains a slightly modified CBSPMeshFileLoader.cpp, that will load the first 4 bytes of the .bsp to automatically choose between Q3 and MOHAA mesh loader.

A test example can be found here: http://pastebin.com/ecb7Fe1i
