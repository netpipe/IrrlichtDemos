        <h1>the Game</h1>
        &quot;<a href="http://www.bulletbyte.de">Bulletbyte</a> Marbles&quot; is &quot;a game inspired by 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness">Marble Madness</a>&quot;. I have written it in September 2007 to get used to the
        <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net">Irrlicht</a> 3D engine and the <a href="http://www.ode.org">ODE</a> game physics engine. I
        release this game as &quot;giftware&quot;, i.e. you can do anything you want to with it, play it, have a look at the sources and
        redistribute it however you want, but therefore I do not take any responsibility for usage of the game. <b>Use it at your own risk!</b>.<br>
        The game has 2 play modes:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Play:</b> just try to get through the level as fast as possible, but you can use any time you want.</li>
          <li><b>Challenge:</b> you 
            are fighting against the best time yet scored (or against an initial time if no time was scored yet) in the level.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="pix/checkpoints.jpg" align="left">To make it through a level you have to get to all checkpoint within the level and reach 
        the finishing checkpoint. In the upper left of the window you can see the status of the checkpoints and the time you have already used
        in the level or the time left to finish the level in &quot;challenge&quot; mode. If you reach a checkpoint the according image will be
        shown colored and show you the game time when you reached the checkpoint. On the lower edge of the window the speed of you marble is
        displayed.
      </div><br>
      <a name="controls"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Controls</h1>
        The game is completely controlled by mouse. If you move the mouse you can add a torque to the marble. If you push the right mouse button
        and move the mouse the position of the camera will be changed. Use the mouse wheel to adjust the distance from the camera to the marble.
        Using the left mouse button will focus on the next checkpoint. You have to reach all checkpoints and you have to reach them in the right order.
      </div><br>
      <a name="levels"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>the Levels</h1>
        The following section gives you an overview over the levels of the game and some hints on how to finish them.<br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl1"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 1: &quot;Beginner's First&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/beginner.jpg"><br>
        This is an easy level. Just follow the path marked in orange in the image above, touch both checkpoints any you will easily reach the finish.
        <br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl2"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 2: &quot;Classic 1&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/classic1.jpg"><br>
        This is another simple level. Just follow the orange path again and you're done.<br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl3"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 3: &quot;Classic 2&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/classic2.jpg"><br>
        This time it isn't that easy any more. After starting the level you must take control at once or your marble will drop into a hole right
        under the starting point. The next part is easy, but the first little jump should be done with care. Make sure you are not jumping down too
        fast or you will not recover control before falling off the level. The way from checkpoint 1 to checkpoint 2 is pretty easy, but you must
        take care to stay on that narrow path. When you have reached the second checkpoint you get on a wooden hill with a jumppad after the hill
        that will push you up to checkpoint 3. Make sure you are not going on that jumppad too fast or it will just knock you under the plane
        with the checkpoint on. After checkpoint 3 you go down a hill covered with ice so you should really take a good aim. The rest is easy:
        move over the second hill and touch the finishing flag.<br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl4"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 4: &quot;Advanced 1&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/advanced1.jpg"><br>
        Despite it's name this level is simple again. Just follow the orange path to the finish and you're done.<br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl5"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 5: &quot;Advanced 2&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/advanced2_1.jpg"><br>
        In this level you must first roll over a pretty small bridge and get up some stairs. You should not try to get up there too fast or you might
        lose control over your marble.<br>
        <img src="pix/advanced2_2.jpg"><br>
        Now you must get over the next narrow bridge with a torous in the middle. Be careful there. After reaching the second checkpoint you go down
        the boxes that lead you to checkpoint 3. After this one you must climb up an almost vertical wall (this can be done ... you just have to touch
        the wall without moving and start to move again) which leads you to a maze that is badly lit. After that it's just a small step to finish.
      </div>
      <a name="lvl6"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 6: &quot;Upstairs&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/upstairs_1.jpg"><br>
        This level will bring you to quite a lot of stairs. Climb up all of them but don't forget - if you get too fast you will lose control over
        your marble.<br>
        <img src="pix/upstairs_2.jpg"><br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl7"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 7: &quot;Downstairs&quot;</h1>
        This level is the same as in &quot;<a href="#lvl6">Upstairs</a>&quot;, just the other way round. You will notice that losing control is even
        simpler when going down the stairs.<br>&nbsp;
      </div>
      <a name="lvl8"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 8: &quot;Stunt Marble Racer 1&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/smr1.jpg"><br>
        The next three levels are inspired by another one of my favorite 80ies games: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Car_Racer">Stunt
        Car Racer</a>. In the first one you have a jump in the beginning. You must find the right speed for that jump so you don't fall off the
        track and you regain control before the next corner. After that a small jump leads you to the only checkpoint in the level. After this
        corner you must accelerate to the right speed so you can take the next jump without falling off. After that jump a steep turn waits for 
        you which will lead you to some steps before the finishing flag.
      </div>
      <a name="lvl9"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 9: &quot;Stunt Marble Racer 2&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/smr2.jpg"><br>
        OK, this one is pretty hard. Going through the loop is pretty hard, because once you are upside down the left/right controls flip, i.e.
        moving the mouse left will move your marble right once you are upside down. Even after the loop this level is no fun. You must get
        up to the checkpoint but because of bad level design this is also really hard. After the checkpoint it's a simple level.
      </div>
      <a name="lvla"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 10: &quot;Stunt Marble Racer 3&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/smr3.jpg"><br>
        I like this level. Play it most of the time. There are two small jumps at the beginning, it turned out that it is easier to stop the marble
        before the second jump. Then you just have to follow the path to get to checkpoints one, two and three. The way to checkpoint four is
        equipped with two doulbe jumps which need the right speed (again) or you will either fall of the track or lose a lot of time. After checkpoint
        four just go through the last corner and over the last hill (not too fast!!) and you will jump right into finish.
      </div>
      <a name="lvlb"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 11: &quot;Push and Ice&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/pushandice.jpg"><br>
        Another simple level. It was just itended to test ice, jumppads and acceleration pads, so it's really simple. But I wouldn't go on the jumppads,
        it's easier to go over the ice plane.
      </div>
      <a name="lvlc"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 12: &quot;a World of Ice&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/worldofice.jpg"><br>
        This level gives you some options: in order to get up on the higher plane you can either use the jumppad or on of the two no-jump paths.
        After that you will see some icy ways to go, but it's not that hard. Except for the way from the second checkpoint to the finish. You
        have an acceleration pad right after the checkpoint and it's not so easy to keep the marble on the right way to the finishing flag.
      </div>
      <a name="lvld"></a>
      <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Level 13: &quot;3 jump&quot;</h1>
        <img src="pix/3jump.jpg"><br>
        Not so hard. Just figure out how fast you have to be to get on the next plane. The second and the third planes are checkpoints in this
        level so it's enough to just touch them, but jumping to the finishing flag requires some better aiming.
