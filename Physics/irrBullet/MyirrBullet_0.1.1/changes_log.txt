	Added: IBulletWorld function to get number of Active or Sleeping objects.
	Fixed: getName() function in ICollisionShape
	Fixed: ISphereShape scale 
	Added: Function to IBulletWorld to draw debug properties to the GUI environment
	Improved: Cleaned up source files and removed some unnecessary things
	Added: IGImpactMeshShape for GImpact rigid body triangle meshes
	Fixed: Now classes derived from ICollisionShape actually update their inertia
	Improved: Improved coding in the header files
	Added: All rigid bodies now use IMotionState instead of btDefaultMotionState
	Added: IBvhTriangleMeshShape is now supported
	Changed: ICollisionShape::setLocalScaling() now scales the scene node it controls
	Added: autoCalculateCcdValues() to IRigidBody to automatically set Continuous 
		Collision Detection values to avoid tunneling of fast moving objects.
	Added: setCcdValues() to IRigidBody to manually set Continous Collision Detection 
		values to avoid tunneling of fast moving objects.
	Removed: updateRigidBody() from IRigidBody
	Added: New class ICollisionObject, which all other objects inherit from
	Changed: EPhysicsBodyState in common.h renamed to EActivationState and moved to collisionobject.h
	Changed: EAS_ALL removed. debugDrawProperties() directly affected.\
	Improved: ICollisionObject now has all needed original btCollisionObject functions.
	Improved: IRigidBody now has all needed original btRigidBody functions.
	Improved: Collision masks for IRigidBody are now finished and ready to be used.
	Changed: setCollisionFlags() now takes ECollisionFlag as a parameter instead of u32.
