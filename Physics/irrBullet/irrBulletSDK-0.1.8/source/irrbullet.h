    @section intro Introduction

    Welcome to the irrBullet API documenation.

    If you have any questions or suggestions, please email them to me at fighterstw@hotmail.com.


    @section irrbulletexample irrBullet Example

    Using irrBullet with Irrlicht is very straight-forward and simple.


    Example source code and projects can be found in (<irrBulletDir> / examples),
    and compiled examples can be found in (<irrBulletDir> / bin / win32_gcc).


    @section linkerandsearchdirs Linker and Search Directories Settings

    Before you can begin integrating irrBullet in your application, there are a few things
    to add to your project first.

    Link against these static libraries (included in (<irrBulletDir> / lib), pre-compiled):

        <b>libirrBullet.a/.lib
        libbulletdynamics.a/.lib
        libbulletsoftbody.a/.lib
        libGIMPACTUtils.a/.lib
        liblinearmath.a/.lib
        libbulletcollision.a/.lib</b>

    This is for most features and with GImpact included. Other libs must be linked against for some features,
    such as libconvexdecomposition.a for decomposing objects.

    <i>It is important that they are linked against in this order to avoid linker errors.</i>


    Next, add these directories to your Search Directories list:

        <b>
        <irrBulletDirectory> / source
        <irrBulletDirectory> / source / bheaders
        <irrBulletDirectory> / source / bheaders / bullet
        </b>

    Then just include irrBullet.h into the top of your files using irrBullet.


    You are now ready to begin the integration process!
