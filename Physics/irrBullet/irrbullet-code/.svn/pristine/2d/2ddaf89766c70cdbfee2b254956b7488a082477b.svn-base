The purpose of the "DeprecatedCancelled" folder in the irrBullet source folder
is to act as a container for all the cancelled or deprecated irrBullet features to be 
placed in case they could be recycled or used as examples for later features.

The license of these files is still the same as the official irrBullet source files. (ZLib)
