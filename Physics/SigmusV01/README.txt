Sigmus - Version 0.1

Notes:

- Jumping does not work completely. There is no function to detect when the player reaches the ground currently, but one will be implemented soon. For now, you will be able to jump again exactly one second after intiating the current jump. Try not to use this too cheat...

- If you find that you need to activate all projectiles in order to fire more, then try switching your firing mode. There are 3 - Single, Triple, and Limited. In Single, you may only fire one projectile at a time (you must activate it to fire more). In Triple, you may fire three, and in Limited you may fire as many as your ammo allows.

- The tutorial sounds stop playing as soon as a new one starts. In the next version, I'll change it from audio, to on-screen scrolling text. For now, just wait for the audio to finish before moving on.

- The controls aren't explained anywhere, so here they are - WASD for movement. Mouse to look around. Left-click to shoot (hold it down for more power), and Right-click to activate projectiles. Use the scroll-wheel to select different projectile types, and use [Q] to switch between firing modes. Jump is [Space], but as I've said before, try not to use it too much.

- The training level is also supposed to include a turret. I'm having trouble with its rotation though, so it isn't included in the map. It is however implemented. Check out the turret.cpp and turret.h files if you wanna take a look.

- ALL SOURCE IS INCLUDED. Please don't copy things and claim them as your own. I don't care if you use anything, but at least mention me somewhere =]

Enjoy!
