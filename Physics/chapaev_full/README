---------------------------------------
	0.1. Operating system
---------------------------------------

Best: GNU/Linux.
Worst: M$ Windows.

It may work on other POSIX systems, I didn't check it.

---------------------------------------
	0.2. Libraries
---------------------------------------

a) Irrlicht >= 1.1;
b) ODE >= 0.6;
c) OpenGL >= 1.2 (if you want fast rendering).

You can use very slow Software renderer if your OpenGL version
is too old or you, surprisingly, don't have it installed.
M$ DirectX is not supported at the moment, and I hope
it'll never be supported.

---------------------------------------
	0.3. Compiler
---------------------------------------

Under GNU/Linux you'll need, of course, GCC >= 3.
Under M$ Windows I recommend to use GCC >= 3 too. I didn't succeed in
compiling the applicatin with M$ Visual Studio 2003 compiler.

---------------------------------------
1.1. Compilation environment
---------------------------------------

All (am I right?) GNU/Linux distributions install development
packages by default, so you already have everything for development.

Under Windows you need:
a) MinGW (plus MSYS and MSYS-DTK if you want to compile ODE)
or CygWin (I didn't work with that one).
b) Code::Blocks Studio.

---------------------------------------
1.2. Libraries compilation
---------------------------------------

a) Irrlicht

Under GNU/Linux simply run
	$ make
in irrlicht/source/Irrlicht directory.

NOTE: You must install Irrlicht library and headers into /usr/local
to conform Makefile.

You may encounter the problem with glXGetProcAddress or smth when
compiling COpenGLDriver.cpp
That's not a big problem. You should just add
	#define IRR_OGL_LOAD_EXTENSION glXGetProcAddressARB
or
	#define IRR_OGL_LOAD_EXTENSION glXGetProcAddress
after
	#ifdef GLX_VERSION_<ver_num>
	...
	#endif
block.

Under M$ Windows you need to install MinGW (or CygWin)
[both contain GCC], then Code::Blocks Studio.
Code::Blocks Studio will automatically detect available compilers,
but I will only explain how to compile with GCC. So set GCC as default
compiler.

Now go to irrlicht/sorce/Irrlicht directory and simply
double-click on Irrlicht.cbp file.
Since we don't support M$ DirectX you can disable its support in Irrlicht.
Go to Headers->Include->IrrCompileConfig.h and comment the following lines:
	#define _IRR_COMPILE_WITH_DIRECT3D_<ver_num>
Select Build menu->Build or press <Ctrl+F9> to build Irrlicht.

You will find Irrlicht.dll and libIrrlicht.a libraries in
irrlicht/bin/Win32-gcc directory.

You may encounter the problem with gluCheckExtension or smth.
That's not a big problem either. Simply comment
	#ifdef GLU_VERSION_<ver_num>
	...
	#else
block and also
	#endif
a bit lower.

b) ODE

Under GNU/Linux simply run
	$ ./configure --enable-opcode
	$ make

NOTE: You must install ODE library and headers into /usr/local
to conform Makefile.

Under M$ Windows you need either MinGW + MSYS + MSYS-DTK, or CygWin.
If you use MSYS and MSYS-DTK, you can simply run
	$ ./configure --enable-opcode
	$ make

---------------------------------------
1.3. Application compilation
---------------------------------------

Under GNU/Linux simply run
	$ make

Under M$ Windows use Code::Blocks Studio.
You must make sure Code::Blocks Studio can find Irrlicht and ODE.
Go to Build menu->Compiler options->Linker tab.
Add path(s) to libIrrlicht.a and libode.a
Go to Directories tab->Compiler tab.
Add path(s) to Irrlicht and ODE headers.
Go to Directories tab->Linker tab.
Add path(s) to libIrrlicht.a and libode.a

Application will require Irrlicht.dll and libode.dll in oder to run.
You can place them to WINDOWS/SYSTEM directory.

---------------------------------------
2.1. Getting API
---------------------------------------

Under GNU/Linux if you have Doxygen installed, you can generate
API documentation running
	$ make api

May be it's possible to install Doxygen under MinGW and CygWin,
I didn't try that.

---------------------------------------
3.1. About Open Source and everything...
---------------------------------------

GNU/Linux (and probaly all POSIX) are best suitable for OpenGL.
M$ Windows' OpenGL is not that good, and it becomes now even more
buggy with political M$ decision to kill OpenGL by making M$ Windows'
OpenGL just a layer upon M$ DirectX.
You know, I don't like M$ for that and many-many other things.
You should really try GNU/Linux. You will find a great amount of
distributions which offer either more user friendly approach, or
more internals-learning approach. It's no longer true that GNU/Linux
is harder to install/use than M$ Windows. You can even have Ubuntu
distribution CDs shipped for you for zero money!
The OSRPG project purpose is to create Open Source RPG to prove
that Open Source can make anything and that you can do everything under
GNU/Linux. Even play the best RPG!

Also, nVIDIA supports *nix best of all, while ATI lacks video drivers
for recent notebook video card graphics chipsets (correct me if I'm wrong).
Decide wisely which video card to use.
