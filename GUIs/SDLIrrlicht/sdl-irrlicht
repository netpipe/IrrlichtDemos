No, no. You have to compile Irrlicht with the SDL device and create the device with EDT_SDL. Then you can ask Irrlicht video driver->getExposedVideoData() for the internal device structures, which, if you are lucky, are the screen value. But you have to look this up in the SDL device source code, because it's not yet documented.

I have to reaktivate this old thread because I saw that in the newest version of irrlicht there is the option to run irrlicht based on SDL

to get it running on my linux pc I had to do a few steps

in makefile (irrlicht/source)
CPPFLAGS = $(CXXINCS) -DIRRLICHT_EXPORTS=1 -D_IRR_USE_SDL_DEVICE_

in COpenGLExtensionHandler.h

line 37, I added
#include <SDL/SDL_video.h>
(for SDL_GL_GetProcAddress )

for compiling the samples I added
-I/usr/include/SDL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT
to CPPFLAGS
and
-L/usr/lib -lSDL
to LDFLAGS
in the sample makefiles

 reinterpret_cast<HWND>(video::IVideoDriver::getExposedVideoData()->OpenGLWin32.HWnd)
