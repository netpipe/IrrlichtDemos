/*
This Tutorial shows how to load a Quake 3 map into the
engine, create a SceneNode for optimizing the speed of
rendering and how to create a user controlled camera.

Lets start like the HelloWorld example: We include
the irrlicht header files and an additional file to be able
to ask the user for a driver type using the console.

#include <irrlicht.h>
#include <iostream>

/*
Include SDL.h so that we can use sdl's fun and interesting
input abilities.

#include <SDL/SDL.h>

/*
As already written in the HelloWorld example, in the Irrlicht
Engine, everything can be found in the namespace 'irr'.
To get rid of the irr:: in front of the name of every class,
we tell the compiler that we use that namespace from now on,
and we will not have to write that 'irr::'.
There are 5 other sub namespaces 'core', 'scene', 'video',
'io' and 'gui'. Unlike in the HelloWorld example,
we do not a 'using namespace' for these 5 other namespaces
because in this way you will see what can be found in which
namespace. But if you like, you can also include the namespaces
like in the previous example. Code just like you want to.

/*
Again, to be able to use the Irrlicht.DLL file, we need to link with the
Irrlicht.lib. We could set this option in the project settings, but
to make it easy, we use a pragma comment lib:

Ok, lets start. Again, we use the main() method as start, not the

	they are only a huge chunk of static geometry with some materials
	attached. Hence the IAnimated mesh consists of only one frame,
	so we get the "first frame" of the "animation", which is our quake level
	and create an OctTree scene node with it, using addOctTreeSceneNode().
	The OctTree optimizes the scene a little bit, trying to draw only geometry
	which is currently visible. An alternative to the OctTree would be a
	AnimatedMeshSceneNode, which would draw always the complete geometry of
	the mesh, without optimization. Try it out: Write addAnimatedMeshSceneNode
	instead of addOctTreeSceneNode and compare the primitives drawed by the
	video driver. (There is a getPrimitiveCountDrawed() method in the
	IVideoDriver class). Note that this optimization with the Octree is only
	useful when drawing huge meshes consiting of lots of geometry.

	Now we only need a Camera to look at the Quake 3 map.

	different cameras available in the Irrlicht engine. For example the
	Maya Camera which can be controlled compareable to the camera in Maya:
	Rotate with left mouse button pressed, Zoom with both buttons pressed,
	translate with right mouse button pressed. This could be created with
