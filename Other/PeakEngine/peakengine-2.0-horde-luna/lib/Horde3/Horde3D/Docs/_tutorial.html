<h1>Getting started - a small tutorial</h1>

<p>
In this section we will create a simple application that loads a character and animates it
using a walk cycle. You will see how straightforward it is to use the Horde3D API. As a first step
you have to create an application that opens a window which can be used for rendering. This
is a pretty standard task and if you are a novice and have problems with that on your platform
use google to find one of the numerous good tutorials on the net or have a look at the samples
that come with the Horde3D SDK. The next step is to initalize an OpenGL context for our rendering
window. You can do this manually or use the Horde3D Utility Library to make your life easier. After
that is done we can finally get to the engine related part.

The first line of the code above declares two global handles to Horde scene graph nodes. All objects in Horde
are accessible via handles, a concept similar to pointers. The first thing we need to do in our <i>initGame</i>
function to use Horde3D is initializing the engine. This happens with the function <b>init</b>. After that we
tell the engine the size of our rendering window so that it can adjust the viewport.
<br /><br />
The next step is to load the required resources. In Horde resources are data files that are loaded once and
can be referenced by several objects for rendering. The function <b>addResource</b> takes the resource type
we want to add and the name of the resource (usually the filename) as parameters and returns a handle to the
created resource object. In our case we want a model which is represented as a scene graph file in Horde and
additionally an animation. Now the resources are created but we still need to load them. Horde supports loading
from any sources including encrypted archives or a network but in this case we just want to load our resources
from the local hard disk which is done with the utility function <b>loadResourcesFromDisk</b>. 
Besides our model and animation we also load a pipeline resource. A pipeline defines how the the scene is rendered
and can be used to realize post-processing effects or high dyanmic range rendering. For the beginning you can just use
the files that come with the SDK samples. 
<br /><br />
After we have loaded the required resources we can finally build up the scene graph. The scene graph represents
the objects in our virtual world in a hierachical tree structure. First we add the model that we have loaded before.
We use the function <b>addNodes</b> for doing this which takes a scene graph resource and a parent node. The parent
is the scene object to which the new node is attached, in our case just the root node which is the base of the
virtual world. Similar to addResource this function also returns a handle to the created scene graph subtree.
After that we assign the loaded animation to our model node with the function <b>setupModelAnimStage</b>. Horde
allows you to apply several different animations to a model and makes it possible to blend and mix them but for
the beginning one should be enough. Now that adding the model is finished we still need a light source. It would be
possible to load another scene graph file which contains the light source but we want to add it manually by using
the <b>addLightNode</b> function. This function requires several parameters specifying the shaders used for
rendering. More information on this can be found in other sections of the manual. The next step is to set the
position and orientation which is done with <b>setNodeTransform</b>. After that we specify the light radius which
defines the zone of influence using <b>setLightParam</b>. Finally we still need a camera which represents the viewer.
It is added with the function <b>addCameraNode</b> and takes our loaded pipeline resource as parameter.

<b>void</b> gameLoop( <b>float</b> fps )
{
    <b>static float</b> t = 0;
    
    <i>// Increase animation time</i>
    t = t + 10.0f * (1 / fps);
    
    <i>// Play animation</i>
    Horde3D::setModelAnimParams( model, 0, t, 1.0f );
    
    <i>// Set new model position</i>
    Horde3D::setNodeTransform( model, t * 10, 0, 0,     <i>// Translation</i>
                                           0, 0, 0,     <i>// Rotation</i>
                                           1, 1, 1 );   <i>// Scale</i>
										   
    <i>// Render scene </i>
    Horde3D::render( cam );
}


<b>void</b> releaseGame()
{
    <i>// Release engine</i>
    Horde3D::release();
}

<p>
The next function in our sample is the game loop which is called once every frame. Here we will animate our
character model. For doing this we define a time counter which is increased in every frame. To make the animation
speed independent from the framerate, we scale the time step by the inverse of the current frames per second value.
After that we tell the engine to update the model animation using the <b>setModelAnimParams</b> function. We could
also specify a blend weight for combining animations here but since we have only one animation we don't need that.
Now we can displace our character a bit so that it moves through the scene. This is achieved by updating the model
node transformation. Finally we need to tell the engine to render the scene and recalculate the model animation. This
happens with the function <b>render</b> that expects the camera from which the scene is viewed.
<br /><br />
The last function <i>releaseGame</i> is called when the application is closed. All we have to do here is freeing the
engine with the <b>release</b> function.
