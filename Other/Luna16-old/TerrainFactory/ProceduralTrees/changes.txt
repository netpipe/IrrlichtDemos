Changelog for Klasker's Procedural Trees.
-----------------------------------------

Major versions increase when everything is rewritten from scratch.
Minor versions increase when new features are added.
A character is appended for bug fixes and minor changes to the demo.

-----------------------------------------

Version 2.1c
    * Compatible with Irrlicht 1.4.

Version 2.1b
    * Compatible with Irrlicht 1.3.
    * Now uses swscanf instead of wcstof to convert strings to float, so msvc should compile it now.
    * The demo now renders leaves using a shader, so vertex colors are respected in OpenGL.

Version 2.1a
    * Fixed a bug that would prevent leaves from rotating when they were far away from the camera.


Version 2.1
    * Optimized the leaf billboards. Great performance boost in forests.
    * Refactored the code to allow many trees to share the same set of leaves. Previously only the mesh could be shared.
    * Fixed a bug that would hide the leaves near the transition to the billboard LOD.


Version 2.0
    * Loads tree designs from XML files.
    * Four tree designs included: Oak, Pine, Aspen and Willow.
    * Leaves are now billboards. Looks a lot better.
    * Leaves can have variable vertex colors (defined in the XML file). Very effective.
    * Shadows can be emulated by darkening those leaves on the side of the tree facing away from the light source.
    * The automatic LOD has been revamped. The old method was not very good. Trees now have three levels of detail:
      1. Full detail
      2. Low detail: Radial segments reduced to 4, highest branches are cut.
      3. Billboard: Tree becomes a billboard.
    * Trees can be scaled and rotated without breaking (mostly the billboard leaves were problematic here). This is useful for water reflections.
    * Note that wind is no longer supported. I will work on this.
