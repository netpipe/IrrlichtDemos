PhoenixCore
============

PhoenixCore is an experimental 2D rendering framework based on OpenGL and written in C++. It is a fairly abstract library for rendering 2D geometry. PhoenixCore's features include:

 * Setting up an OpenGL Context.
 * Processing user Input (Keyboard, Mouse).
 * Managing OpenGL Context (swapping buffers, etc).
 * Provides abstract math classes for Vectors and Matrices.
 * Provides interface to loading and manipulating Textures.
 * Provides methods to modify the View Port and Transformation Matrix.
 * Provides classes for representing geometric primitives.
 * Provides methods for drawing geometric primitives.
 * Provides abstract class for Color representation and manipulation.
 * Provides access to high-precision timers.
 * Provides high-level threaded resource management.
 * Implements an experimental automatic optimizing batch renderer.


Goals
=====

Phoenix's main goal is to provide and abstract interface for drawing 2d geometry with OpenGL. Phoenix is very basic, and does not provide features such as physics, sound, collision, or even a high level sprite class. However, phoenix is designed to integrate with other systems very easily


What Phoenix Is Not
===================

Phoenix is not a complete library for game development. It does not provide many of the needed libraries for game development. However, Phoenix is a good base and integrates very well with other libraries such as OpenAL, Box2D, etc.


Building
========

Requirements
------------

 * Cmake 2.8 or newer
 * Boost C++ Libraries (1.37 or newer)
 * Boost Threads
 * Boost Datetime
 * Boost Signals 2
 * GLFW (2.7 or newer)

Boost and GLFW are usually available via the package manager on many Linux distributions. 

On Windows you can download GLFW from [their website](http://glfw.sourceforge.net/) 
and I highly suggest you use the Boost Installer from Boost Pro Consulting.


Linux/Unixes
------------

 * mkdir build && cd build
 * cmake ..
 * make


Windows
-------

  * mkdir build
  * cd build
  * Invoke CMake with the generator and paths to the libraries, should be similar to:

    cmake -G"Visual Studio 10" -DGLFW_PATH="J:\Development\glfw-lite" -DPHOENIX_PATH="J:\Development\phoenixgl" -DBOX2D_PATH="J:\Development\Box2D" -DBOOST_ROOT="D:\boost_1_47" ..

  * A Visual Studio solution should be generated that will allow you to build the core library, tests, and examples.


Special Thanks
==============
There are a couple of brave souls that made PhoenixCore possible, among these are:

 * Denzel Morris
 * [Sven Bergstr√∂m](https://github.com/FuzzYspo0N)
 * Brian Labbe
 * Chris Parich
