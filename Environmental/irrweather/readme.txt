Thanks for using irrWeatherManager!

This was originally created for the Fighters Tactical Warfare combat simulation project, and is now
released, open-source, to C++ developers to use in their Irrlicht projects.

A lot of credit is due to Pazystamo and Bitplane for their two great projects:
ATMOsphere and Cloud Scene Node

These are a major part of the weather manager.


Please report bugs and give feedback at fighterstw@hotmail.com
