	Added: IWeatherManagerAtmosphere::getCompoundCelestialBodySceneNode()
	Added: "Imposter" LOD system for clouds (experimental)
	Added: ICloudLayer::get/setImposterUpdateFrequency(), get/setImposterImposterDistance(), get/setImposterEnabled()
	Added: camera position and target threshold-based particle-orientation LOD system
	Added: irrWeatherManager SVN (hosted by Sourceforge)
	Added: ICloudLayer::get/setCameraPositionThreshold() and get/setCameraTargetThreshold
