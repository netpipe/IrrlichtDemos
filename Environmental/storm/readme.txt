Storm effect using frustrum in eye space:

Instruction:
Press 'F4' to start effect.
Press 'F5' to stop effect.

Your have to change a few (#define) params to point to the proper directories, e.g.

makefile:
IRRLICHT_DIR = /home/smso/downloads/irrlicht/irrlicht-svn

main.cpp:
#define IRRLICHT_DIR "/home/smso/downloads/irrlicht/irrlicht-svn/"
