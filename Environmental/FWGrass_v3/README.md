# GrassGenerator

Author = devsh

Old Irrlicht 1.7.1 school project circa 2011

This project was done by me for an ICT coursework when I was 16, given the age at my approach to programming at the time, this code has an unusual amount of documentation (sometimes even pointless such as implementation.pdf).

If you want to recompile, better grab stock irrlicht 1.7.1

The generator is multithreaded and accepts painted maps as input. This approach is completely obsolete in 2018, as I would use compute shaders or at least feedback transform and do the whole thing on the GPU start to finish.

Put on github for archival purposes.
