yeah.. this one is realy wip. 
It is some kind of fake refraction, but unfotunably your able to see the dwarf through all walls. 
The idea behind is quite simple. I have a shader, that makes out of a Objetc a "normalmap"
(it renders the normals in viewProjektionspace)
Then I use this normalmap to modefy the final image...
But since the dwarf is rendered in a extrapass, it wont be hidden by any objekts...
