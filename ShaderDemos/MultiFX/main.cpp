/*

This Tutorial shows how to load a Quake 3 map into the

engine, create a SceneNode for optimizing the speed of

rendering and how to create a user controlled camera.



Lets start like the HelloWorld example: We include

the irrlicht header files and an additional file to be able

to ask the user for a driver type using the console.

*/

#include <irrlicht.h>

#include <iostream>


//Include the CEffects header

#include "CEffects.h"



/*

As already written in the HelloWorld example, in the Irrlicht

Engine, everything can be found in the namespace 'irr'.

To get rid of the irr:: in front of the name of every class,

we tell the compiler that we use that namespace from now on,

and we will not have to write that 'irr::'.

There are 5 other sub namespaces 'core', 'scene', 'video',

'io' and 'gui'. Unlike in the HelloWorld example,

we do not a 'using namespace' for these 5 other namespaces

because in this way you will see what can be found in which

namespace. But if you like, you can also include the namespaces

like in the previous example. Code just like you want to.

*/

using namespace irr;



/*

Again, to be able to use the Irrlicht.DLL file, we need to link with the

Irrlicht.lib. We could set this option in the project settings, but

to make it easy, we use a pragma comment lib:

*/

#pragma comment(lib, "Irrlicht.lib")



//Init the "RenderEffect" variable

int RenderEffect = 0;



class MyEventReceiver : public IEventReceiver

{

public:



   virtual bool OnEvent(const SEvent &event)

   {

      //Test if keyboard event and what key are pressed

      if (event.EventType == EET_KEY_INPUT_EVENT && event.KeyInput.PressedDown == false)

      {

         switch(event.KeyInput.Key)

         {

            case KEY_KEY_N: RenderEffect=0;

               return true;

            case KEY_KEY_G: RenderEffect=1;

Ok, lets start. Again, we use the main() method as start, not the

WinMain(), because its shorter to write.

   printf("Please select the driver you want for this example:\n"\

   // create device and exit if creation failed

   IrrlichtDevice* device = createDevice(driverType, core::dimension2d<u32>(800, 600));

   /*

   To display the Quake 3 map, we first need to load it. Quake 3 maps

   are packed into .pk3 files wich are nothing other than .zip files.

   So we add the .pk3 file to our FileSystem. After it was added,

   we are able to read from the files in that archive as they would

   directly be stored on disk.

   */

   /*

   Now we can load the mesh by calling getMesh(). We get a pointer returned

   to a IAnimatedMesh. As you know, Quake 3 maps are not really animated,

   they are only a huge chunk of static geometry with some materials

   attached. Hence the IAnimated mesh consists of only one frame,

   so we get the "first frame" of the "animation", which is our quake level

   and create an OctTree scene node with it, using addOctTreeSceneNode().

   The OctTree optimizes the scene a little bit, trying to draw only geometry

   which is currently visible. An alternative to the OctTree would be a

   AnimatedMeshSceneNode, which would draw always the complete geometry of

   the mesh, without optimization. Try it out: Write addAnimatedMeshSceneNode

   instead of addOctTreeSceneNode and compare the primitives drawed by the

   video driver. (There is a getPrimitiveCountDrawed() method in the

   IVideoDriver class). Note that this optimization with the Octree is only

   useful when drawing huge meshes consiting of lots of geometry.
