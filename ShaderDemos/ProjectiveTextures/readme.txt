Compiling code
==============

To compile this code, a framework available on my site is needed,
as well as libraries also available at my site. If there's a
problem with compiling the code, make sure that you got the right
framework, and that you have a recent enough copy of it. If it
still won't compile, refer to my site for ways to contact me.
Also, note that older frameworks may not compile on other compilers
that MSVC 6.0 and gcc.
