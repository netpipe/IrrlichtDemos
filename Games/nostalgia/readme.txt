README FILE FOR NOSTALGIA v1.0
----------By Robert Garand---------------Nov. 2008

Thanks for taking the time to download this little game.
It is my first attempt in game programming, more even in 3d.

TO INSTALL BY HAND
Unzip all files in a folder named of your taste, nostalgia would be good,
then run nostalgia.exe. That's it. Installer will maybe come later.

TO INSTALL WITH INSTALLER
Run setup and follow instruction, defaults should work on most systems.



TO UNINSTALL BY HAND
Just delete the folder you made, sweet, isn't it? no messing in your settings or registry, 
and it works !

TO UNINSTALL WITH INSTALLER
Use the uninstall.exe



CONTROLS
Use mouse to aim canon.
	left and right arrows to move canon.
	left button to fire shell.
	Right button to aim missiles at enemies, 
	takes a second to lock and auto-fires when lock on the target.
	when you hear the bip, you're on target.
	

P pause/unpause game, to access menu, or answer the phone ;)
V change video settings
S change sound parameters
C change camera to fps to view world, but don't pause game itself.( just for the fun of it I like looking at missile by sideview)
F1 help window.

TROOBLESHOOTING

If the game fails to start, open the settings.xml file in an editor like notepad (not in firefox or Iexplorer) and write in your screen resolution.
At start, it is 1024x768 at 32 bits. Should play on any computer very well, but lower the resolution and depth if any problem.

If you don't have shadow, turn on stancilbuffer.

The game is optimized for P4 with SSE support.

Game currently play in OpenGl only for portability, and I hate M$oft, too many updates.
So if you get a message about OpenGL version too low (1.3 and higher needed) try updating your video drivers.

ABOUT THE GAME


Game plays better in full screen.

You can adjust your audio setting and interface transparency with menu file->sound & parameters
You can adjust your video settings with file->Change video mode.
after changing video save them and restart the game for it to take effect.

You can use the defaultsetting.xml or defaultparameters.xml to restore your settings, if something goes wrong.

FROM THE AUTOR

This game is an opposition to game makers who keep on trying to make their games as life-like as possible,
for me it is the opposite, you can go much farther and make things even more funnier then in real life,
sky is the limit as some say. So you'll see nothing like life imitation in there...


This game is an "essay", I wanted to know if I could do it...now I'll go on with something more elaborate,
If anyone interested to get involve, have questions or commentaries, mail me at rgarand@videotron.ca.
