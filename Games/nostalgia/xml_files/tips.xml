Shoot jets first they come faster.

Jets can be shot by bullets too ;)

Notice how you can't target thru smoke...

If you shoot shells to loosely, 
you won't have anymore before they reach end of 'world'

Shoot all enemies, even if they've passed towers, 
everyone of them cost you points if they reach end safely !
