<MessageText  caption="About Nostalgia de Robert Garand">
First game made by me,
I used:

Irrlicht as 3d engine,
Irrklang as sound engine,
Code Blocks as compiler
Milk Shape 3D as modeler.

All Great Free Programs, (except MS3D, 42$...a deal)
many thanks to creators
and their community, a lot of good poeples.

I did all aspects, graphic, animation, sound,
trajectory calculation and whatever else !!!
