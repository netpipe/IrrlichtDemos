this is the irrlicht-sdk v 1.3.1 'lite'. no examples, no extra code, no media, just the
bare minimums needed for compiling with your windows platform of choice.

Also included is a default Code::Blocks project file.
*note* this was constructed with the latest C::B nightly build, so if your having trouble,
get that version.
