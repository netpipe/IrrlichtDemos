ABOUT THE GAME:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: PIRATES!... The Rescue...
VERSION: 0.01 (Still under tests - Its just an earlier version, but playable)
SIZE: About 35Mb in total
NOTES: No install is required (fully portable)

This game inteends to be pure entertainment for all family and friends.
Should be playable and easy for everyone at ANY age.
Only 3 main keys: UP + DOWN + SHOOT. No lives, no countdown timers, no stress...
Even a baby that could only press one key (SHOOT) he/she is ready to play!... :)
Audios are soft, no shoot, no fire, no agressive sounds, enemies dont die, no zombies, no blood. 

Has a "retro" platform style game, BUT (!!!) it may need a pretty fast PC to run,
since all graphics are in 3D (even it has a 2D style) and it uses advanced 3D physics.
And... Could be a nice game for your arcade cabinet project... I think!... :)

IMPORTANT: This game needs to be sharped, correct issues (bugs) that may occur, etc, etc...
NOTE: You may change some settings in the "settings.txt" included text file.
