Heres the first code for a terrain. V0.0.2, irrlicht
license, is a hack from Nikos CGeometryCreator.
If you test, think to change the path to your
media-directory, or there will be no sky/shining
water.

The heightmap/texture is from an example from
http://ohad.visual-i.com/, but you can easy paint
others. You can export bmp/jpg to raw for example with
demos of paintshop pro or XnView from
http://www.xnview.com.

Its a so called brute force terrain. Cause theres many ideas
how to do, we put more than one terrain-function in the class.
