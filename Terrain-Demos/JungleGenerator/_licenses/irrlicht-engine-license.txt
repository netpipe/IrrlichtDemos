  The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license.
  Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are
  using the Irrlicht Engine in your product, an acknowledgement
  would be highly appreciated.

  Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of
  the Independent JPEG Group, the zlib, and libpng. This means that if you use
  the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere
  in your documentation that you've used the IJG code and libpng. It would
  also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine and the zlib.
  See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib for
  further informations.
