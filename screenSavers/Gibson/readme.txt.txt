LazerBlade brings you The Gibson Screensaver.


I put this screensaver together in about two months wanting a Gibson screensaver for my computer.
It's written in C++ and uses Ray3D 0.05 which uses Irrlicht for 3d graphics. All of the content
is created by me using Gimp and Blender.

This screensaver is under the GPL v3, see GPL.txt for details.

Please note that you need a fairly powerful computer to run this screensaver. Reccommend a system
with at least 3 GB of RAM and some kind of nice 3D card. I.E, not integrated graphics.


Installation is simple.

Copy this folder to you C: drive. So that you can read this document and see the data
in "C:\Gibson". Right click "Gibson.scr" and hit "Test" to try it out. If you like it and it works,
right click Gibson.scr again and click "Install". This screeensaver has no settings, clicking the
settings button will only preview the screensaver again.

It was my intention to also port to Linux, but due to time constraints I'm only releasing it for
Windows. If any of you bold programmers want to port it to Linux, you may as long as you follow
the GPL 3.


You should also be warned that this screensaver has had minimal testing and may be quite crowded
with bugs. It's likely to be broken in some way or another, although it runs fine for me.

The sourcecode can be found in the src directory, it's just a dump of my Eclipse workspace. Too
much of it is messy though.

Enjoy! :)
