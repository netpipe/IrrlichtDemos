Description             : Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI WRC 1999



			Version 6.0 Final 

			I Made the NEW Evolution VI WRC 1999 and the model is changed on the front so is the texture, 
			the back is textured a little bit different, and the whole texture now features the 1999 VERSION, 
			for the World Rally Cup, new slide and all you know I would put in, to make this car one of the best.
			
			Drive Like a Pro , if you can handle it of course.,

			********************************************

			Well after all it took a very long time , from the first version of the Evo V SV untill the 
			version 6.0, but...... it looks better than ever !

			To be honest , I think this is the BEST one so far, I prefer the Subaru 555 WRC of course, due
			to the fact I have My OWN Subaru , but for the NFS3 cars , I think this one is the best around from 
			my hands so far, but see for yourself.
			
			I had to edit the body completely, resize it and scale it , move the vertices around,and I even 
			added the REAL EVO V WRC Spoiler onto it ! The body now has Skirts on the bottom om the sides,
			a Licence plate and I fixed all the textures, they are now non-mirrored where necessary , 
			also added ,an interior, 2 Drivers, with Helmet, and transparant vizer and FACE,bodies in the official 
			colors of the team ! I also changed the performance a tiny bit !
			I added a REAL Mitsubishi Dash , I was lucky to get a good photo , so it is now inside the car, 
			and it looks like the real thing now ! Addict thanx for thinking along !!
			Updated the Load screen only with the "Patwo Design productions 1999 " text changed !
			Well of course I like to thank all the guys that helped me with some good advice , critics and compliments, 	
			Everyone , THANX a lot !!
			I hope you have a very good time driving the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V WRC , GIVE it a try against
			the Subaru 555 WRC, they are almost identical ..... so the Drivers make the difference, so if you are
			up to it and dare to drive it ! Go AHead !!!1
			last but not least, before everyone is going to mail me the Lancer and Carisma are almost identical, 	
			Mitsubishi is calling in some countries the Lancer a Carisma and vice versa, it has to do with the	
			advertising campaign, so if you think it looks like a Carisma , you are right and if you think it looks like a 
			Lancer you are also right ! SO don't mail me about it !

			HAVE FUN and CU

			 Version 1.0	
			Well it took me a while ( due to very little time) but it is finally here. The Mitsubishi
			Lancer Evolution V WRC.  Born as a request for another WRC car, next to the Subaru 
			Impreza WRC. So here is THE competitor for the Subaru. Now you can drive Tommy Makinen
			against Colin Mc Rae, at home at your own PC, with friends over the net or whatever config you can 
			establish.  This year the Mitsubishi EVO V won the World Campionship Rally 1998 , just before the Subaru 
			of Colin Mc Rae. So Subaru had to pass on this year, not their 4th victory in a row. 
			
			I decided, that because the cars look a lot like eachother qua performance and driving in real life. So that 
			is also implemented in the game cars. The Subaru WRC or The Evo WRC, drive similar with only minor 
			differences in performance, and handling. So it is not a matter of GOOD driving this time to win , but now it is 
			only a matter of being the BEST, know the tracks and your car's handling and that is the only way to succeed. 
			These WRC's are driven to the maximum of performance and often challenge the elements and physics of nature.
			So you want to be the best !?!?!?!?,   keep on practising and in the end it will fly around the tracks.
			Of course there is also a Automatic option , in the gear selections set, but WRC's are not made for slow
			and afraid to shift gears people. So be a PRO drive it in manual , and the performance is BEST !
			Again just like the Subaru's have lots of FUN driving around the tracks , especially The Lost Canyons is the perfect 
			rally track , due to the large amount of off road tracks.
