One gotchas when adding node
============================

If you press 'A' to add a new node
but the new node is not connected to other nodes inside the large pale blue circle,
deleted it by pressing 'X'.

Then press 'Z' to add a new node with no line-of-sight test.

This is due to the slightly uneven ground which in turn causes the line-of-sight to fail.
