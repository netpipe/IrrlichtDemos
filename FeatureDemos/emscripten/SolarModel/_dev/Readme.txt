Solar Model 2.1 Readme
======================

    The Solar Model is real-time modeling of Solar System. It allows
user to navigate in space, to control time counting (speed-up time
flow) and estimate real movement of space bodies like planets, dwarf
planets and main moons. It also allows user to bind camera to space
objects (for example, you can look from Moon on Earth in real time
flow). Solar Model renders beautiful 3D space environment.
    Application has some very useful features. Some of them are:
Galaxy feature that able to render Milky Way galaxy and Ruler feature
that draws orbits of a planets and their projections on the Sun. As
Solar Model uses own related-sizes system, which only shows what planet
on which place from the Sun, how planets moves and rotates; user cannot
estimate real proportions of the bodies, because real proportions will
simply make all planets difficult to find in the dark space, the Sun
would occupy too much place while comparing it with any other planet.
   Solar Model 2.1 equipped with new feature -- Measurer, which allows
you to compare and measure size of the Sun and planets in real proportions
and their distance to each other.
