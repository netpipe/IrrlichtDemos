/* This tutorials describes how to do special effects. It shows how to use stencil
buffer shadows, the particle system, billboards, dynamic light and the water
surface scene node.

We start like in some tutorials before. Please note that this time, the 'shadows' flag in
createDevice() is set to true, for we want to have a dynamic shadow casted from
an animated character. If your this example runs to slow, set it to false.
The Irrlicht Engine checks if your hardware doesn't support the stencil
buffer, and disables shadows by itself, but just in case the demo runs slow
on your hardware.*/

	did not support the .an8 format when I wrote this tutorial. I am a very bad
	3d graphic artist, and so the texture mapping is not very nice in this model.
	Luckily I am a better programmer than artist, and so the Irrlicht Engine
	is able to create a cool texture mapping for me: Just use the mesh manipulator
	and create a planar texture mapping for the mesh. If you want to see the mapping
	I made with Anim8or, uncomment this line. I also did not figure out how to
	set the material right in Anim8or, it has an emissive light color which I don't really

	/*
	The next special effect is a lot more interesting: A particle system. The particle
	system in the Irrlicht Engine is quit modular and extensible and yet easy to use.
	There is a particle system scene node into which you can put particle emitters, which
	make particles come out of nothing. These emitters are quite flexible and usually have
	lots of parameters like direction, amount and color of the particles they should create.
	There are different emitters, for example a point emitter which lets particles pop out
	at a fixed point. If the particle emitters available in the engine are not enough for
	you, you can easily create your own ones, you'll simply have to create a class derived
	from the IParticleEmitter interface and attach it to the particle system using setEmitter().
	In this example we create a box particle emitter, which creates particles randomly
	inside a box. The parameters define the box, direction of the particles, minimal and
	maximal new particles per second, color and minimal and maximal livetime of the particles.

	Because only with emitters particle system would be a little bit boring,
	there are particle affectors, which modify particles during they fly around. They can
	be added to the particle system, simulating additional effects like gravity or wind.
	The particle affector we use in this example is an affector, which modifies the color
	of the particles: It lets them fade out. Like the particle emitters, additional
	particle affectors can also be implemented by you, simply derive a class from
	IParticleAffector and add it with addAffector().

	After we set a nice material to the particle system, we have a cool looking camp fire.
	By adjusting material, texture, particle emitter and affector parameters, it is also
	easily possible to create smoke, rain, explosions, snow, and so on.

	For creating the shadow, we simply need to call addShadowVolumeSceneNode().
	The color of shadows is only adjustable globally for all shadows, by calling
	ISceneManager::setShadowColor(). Voila, here is our dynamic shadow.

	Because the character is a little bit too small for this scene, we make it bigger
	using setScale(). And because the character is lighted by a dynamic light, we need
	to normalize the normals to make the lighting on it correct. This is always necessary if
	the scale of a dynamic lighted model is not (1,1,1). Otherwise it would get too dark or
